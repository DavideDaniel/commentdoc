# COMMENTDOC

A reason to comment your code, so you don't have to rewrite too much in your README.MD.

### Installation

`npm install commentdoc --save`

### Usage

    var commentDoc = require('commentdoc')
        extract = commentDoc.extract("FILE TO READ.js", "FILE TO WRITE.js"),


### What this does...

COMMENTDOC allows you to comment your code while preparing to write it in your README.MD file. After finishing your app, run COMMENTDOC to have a readme.md written. Go into the readme file and format it the way you like.
